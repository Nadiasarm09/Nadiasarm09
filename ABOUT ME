My name is Nadia, but please call me Nad! I’m an Art Director and multidisciplinary Senior Graphic Designer with more than 10 years of experience. With knowledge of Web3, Blockchain, NFTs, and AI Technology. I've spent the last 3 years working for Fintech companies, helping them shape their brand look and feel, as well as social media presence. 

I’m interested in working with startups, both Fintech, Tech, and gaming.
I’m currently learning 3D animation, and have my eyes on UX and Product Design.
